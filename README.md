🧮 Math is fun Game

📌 Overview
I am a student in sliit city uni and this is my DSA (Distributed Service Architecture) assessment.
This project is a Math Challenge Game designed with a scalable and maintainable architecture. It follows software engineering best practices such as low coupling, high cohesion, event-driven programming, and interoperability. The system is structured into three tiers:

🖥️ Backend API - Handles game logic and authentication

🎨 Frontend MVC Application - User interface and interactions

🗄️ Database - Stores user data and scores

🚀 Features

✅ Math Challenge Game: Solve math problems within 60 seconds, earning 100 points per correct answer.
✅ Leaderboard: Displays top scores, keeping the highest-scoring player at the top.
✅ 🔒 Authentication & Authorization: Secure user authentication using .NET Identity Framework and JWT Tokens.
✅ ⚡ Event-Driven Frontend:

Button clicks and form validations dynamically.

AJAX & Fetch API for seamless communication.

Client-side validation before sending requests to the backend.
✅ 🔗 Interoperability:

Integrates with Banana API for additional functionalities.

Future-ready for React/Angular admin panel integration.
✅ 🎵 User Experience Enhancements:

Retro background music for immersion.

Modern UI elements (popups, alerts, interactive components).

🏗️ Software Architecture

🔹 1. Low Coupling & High Cohesion

The system is divided into distinct layers to minimize dependencies.

Dependency Injection (DI) is used in the backend to decouple components.

Implements a base service class (IBaseService) to modularize API calls.

🔹 2. Event-Driven Programming

The project follows OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism).

Frontend JavaScript enhances interactivity and reduces full-page reloads.

🔹 3. Interoperability

Backend API is decoupled from the frontend to support multiple clients.

Designed for future front-end integrations such as an admin panel in React or Angular.

🔹 4. Virtual Identity & Security

Implements JWT Token Authentication.

Uses .NET Identity Framework for managing user authentication and authorization.

User data is securely stored in browser cookies.
